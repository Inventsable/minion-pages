## CMYK alerts

If the panel has a color assigned from a `Document Color Mode` of `CMYK`, an alert icon will display over the color picker in the UI:

This is to indicate that the panel cannot display this as a `CMYK` value and must simulate it as an `RGB` in the live preview, and can be turned off in `Advanced` under `Ignore CMYK color alerts`.

The correct and original `CMYK` values will always be used when the panel creates outlines.
