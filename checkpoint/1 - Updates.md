## Updates

Contents of the `Help` window like this page will automatically update in realtime, but when a new major version is released with any bugfixes or features that the `Main` panel can use it will indicate this at the bottom left of the UI next to the current version. The most recent version along with a changelog will always be available at the [panel homepage]().

### **Checkpoint will always be free and open source.**

There are no hidden analytics or tricks to make money, I despise advertising way too much to ever use it in any of my sites or tools, and I don't think just because you can make things like this always means you should immediately try or need to monetize it.
