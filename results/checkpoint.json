The most recent version along with a changelog will always be available at the [panel homepage]().\r\n\r\n### **Checkpoint will always be free and open source.**\r\n\r\nThere are no hidden analytics or tricks to make money, I despise advertising way too much to ever use it in any of my sites or tools, and I don't think just because you can make things like this always means you should immediately try or need to monetize it.\r\n"},{"index":2,"title":"Scale Factor","uuid":"pghn","content":"## Scale factor\r\n\r\nTo ensure the live preview works for artwork of all sizes, the panel UI has a draggable number input at the top left of wide layouts:\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Inventsable/minion-pages/master/checkpoint/assets/Scale-Factor-1.png)\r\n\r\nSince default values are set to small artwork, using large numbers in values can cause the panel's live preview to clip or look distorted:\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Inventsable/minion-pages/master/checkpoint/assets/Scale-Factor-2.png)\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed by lowering the `scale` of the live preview effects:\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Inventsable/minion-pages/master/checkpoint/assets/Scale-Factor-3.png)\r\n\r\nThe range of `scale` can be anywhere between a minimum `10` and maximum `250`.\r\n"},{"index":3,"title":"CMYK alerts","uuid":"7nw0","content":"## CMYK alerts\r\n\r\nIf the panel has a color assigned from a `Document Color Mode` of `CMYK`, an alert icon will display over the color picker in the UI:\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Inventsable/minion-pages/master/checkpoint/assets/CMYK-alerts-1.png)\r\n\r\nThis is to indicate that the panel cannot display this as a `CMYK` value and must simulate it as an `RGB` in the live preview, and can be turned off in `Advanced` under `Ignore CMYK color alerts`.\r\n\r\nThe correct and original `CMYK` values will always be used when the panel creates outlines.\r\n"},{"index":4,"title":"Transfer and backup settings","uuid":"9ma2","content":"## Transfer, reset, and backup settings\r\n\r\nThis panel automatically creates a folder for it's own settings and lazyloaded content like these help pages. Whenever you change a setting value, this is written to the following file:\r\n\r\n- Windows: `C:/Users/[USER]/AppData/Roaming/Checkpoint/settings.json`\r\n- Mac: `~/Library/Preferences\\Checkpoint\\settings.json`\r\n\r\nWhen the panel first opens, it will attempt to grab the contents of this file. If you want to transfer settings between machines you can copy the above into the correct location (and create the `Checkpoint` folder if it doesn't yet exist) to have the same settings loaded.\r\n\r\n## Reset\r\n\r\nTo clear all settings back to default, a `Reset data` option exists in the flyout menu of the panel at the very bottom. Note that this will clear all the panel's data and immediately rewrite the above `settings.json` file since the values of the settings have been changed.\r\n"},{"index":5,"title":"Override complex apearances","uuid":"9q8q","content":"## Override complex appearances\r\n"},{"index":10,"title":"Submitting issues","uuid":"hh53","content":"## Submitting issues\r\n"}],"timestamp":1684154334285,"date":{"short":"05/15/23","long":"Monday, May 15th","time":"5:38AM"},"name":"checkpoint"}
